# Vibration-Based Navigation System for the Visually Impaired
## Project Overview
This project introduces a web-based navigation system designed to assist visually impaired users in navigating through urban environments using vibration feedback. By leveraging Google Maps API for routing and the Web Speech API for voice recognition, the system provides an intuitive and accessible way for users to set their destination and receive turn-by-turn navigation instructions through unique vibration patterns.

## Key Features
Voice Recognition: Allows users to set their navigation destination using voice commands, making the application more accessible and easier to use for visually impaired individuals.

Vibration Feedback: Uses distinct vibration patterns to convey different types of navigation instructions (e.g., turn left, turn right, destination reached), which is particularly useful for users with visual impairments.

User Location Detection: Automatically detects and sets the user's current location as the starting point for navigation, simplifying the process of initiating a route.

Google Maps Integration: Incorporates Google Maps API to provide accurate and reliable routing information.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
A modern web browser with support for Geolocation API and Web Speech API (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).

Internet access to load Google Maps API and other online resources.
